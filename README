This is a Django app for per-object-permissions that includes a bunch of
helpers to create custom permission checks.

To get the example project running do:

- Bootstrap the buildout by running::

    python bootstrap.py

- Get the required packages by running::

    bin/buildout

- Sync the database::

    bin/django syncdb

- Run the development server and visit the admin at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/::

    bin/django runserver

Now create a flatage and open it to see some of the templatetags in action.
Full docs coming soon.
