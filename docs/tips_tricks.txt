Hints, tips and tricks

Within a permission class, you can refer to the user and group using self::

    class CampaignPermission(permissions.BasePermission):
        label = 'campaign_permission'
        checks = ('do_foo',)

        def do_foo(self, campaign=None):
            print self.user
            print self.group
            # ...

You can unregister permission classes and re-register them::

    authority.unregister(Campaign)
    authority.register(Campaign, CampaignPermission)
