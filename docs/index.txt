============================================
Welcome to django-authority's documentation!
============================================

django-authority is a layer between Django's basic permission system (provided
through ``django.contrib.auth`` and your application:

Summarized this application provides three abilities:

1. It gives you the ability to add permissions like Django's generic permissions
   to any kind of model without storing them in the model's META attribute.

2. It provides a very simple way to create per-object-permissions. (Also known
   as row level permissions)

3. It wraps Django's generic permissions so you can use the same syntax as
   for the above ones. But note that django-authority does not add any
   voodoo-code to Django's ``contrib.auth`` system so your existing permission
   system keeps intact!
